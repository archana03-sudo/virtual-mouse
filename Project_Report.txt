Project Title: Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

Objective:
To control the mouse cursor using hand gestures via webcam using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe.

Tools Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- PyAutoGUI

Working:
- The webcam captures live video.
- Mediapipe detects the hand and tracks finger positions.
- Index finger is used to move the cursor.
- When index and middle fingers are brought together, a click is triggered.

Applications:
- Touchless UI
- Accessibility tools
- Gesture-based control

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a real-time computer vision application for gesture-controlled system interaction using only a webcam.
